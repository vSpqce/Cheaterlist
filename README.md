# Important
This repository has been archived since both lists it uses have been discontinued.\
Note that most errors in this list are not my fault. I tried my best to fix the mistakes made in the original lists. \
Also, Trueffets deleted a lot of listings during his ownership lmao (from what I was informed, he was paid to delete some of them).

### CheaterList
If you are here you should know what this is. If you don't, this is a list of cheaters (shocking) on Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Most if not all of these cheaters main The Hive.\
Why is this useful? No idea, just convenient for me so I decided to make it public to view lol.\
The program I created is a simple script that changes the date format from DD/MM/YY to MM/DD/YY since most of the dates in CheaterList were in the DMY format.


### Changes
I manually created this text file from the data in the [Koro's Perdition](https://discord.gg/perdition) Discord server.\
I fixed some things and added one listing because koro didn't make an listing embed of it.\
I will probably update this as more listings are added. That's it, have a nice day.


### Updates
#### Update 1 - 10/03/2023
Started uploading evidence images and discord videos to youtube and google drive.
A lot of the images from previous listings were deleted by discord so I'm uploading them to google drive and youtube respectively so they stay long-term.
[Note] I am not re-uploading videos if they weren't originally uploaded to discord.

#### ~~Update 2 - 10/17/2023~~
Since the original #90 listing was deleted from the discord, the server considered the next one #90 but I am keeping every single listing even if it is deleted so I will consider it listing #91.
[Note] Every listing on the Discord from #90 onwards is that listing number incremented by 1 here.

#### Update 3 - 12/12/2023
I want it to be convenient to view this list so I decided to change every listing number to the actual listing number on the CheaterList discord. The deleted listings will still show up if I saved them before deletion.
[Note] This update reverts the number increment in [Update 2](#update-2---10172023)

#### Update 4 - 01/20/2024
Started moving images to folders corresponding with player names to better organize the folder.

#### Update 5 - 01/21/2024
There is a new CheaterList Discord server so the CheaterList 2 file will be the most up to date list.

#### Update 6 - 07/28/2024
Archived.
