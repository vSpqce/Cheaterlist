# Koro's CheaterList in a .txt file
## CheaterList
If you are here you should know what this is. If you don't, this is a list of cheaters (shocking) on Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Most if not all of these cheaters main The Hive.\
Why is this useful? No idea, just convenient for me so I decided to make it public to view lol.\
The program I created is a simple script that changes the date format from DD/MM/YY to MM/DD/YY since most of the dates in CheaterList were in the DMY format.


## Changes
I manually created this text file from the data in the [CheaterList](https://discord.gg/WNKQbacWU8) Discord server.\
I fixed some things and added one listing because koro didn't make an listing embed of it.\
I will probably update this as most listings are added. That's it, have a nice day.


## Updates
#### Update 1 - 10/03/2023
Started uploading evidence images and discord videos to youtube and google drive.
A lot of the images from previous listings were deleted by discord so I'm uploading them to google drive and youtube respectively so they stay long-term.
[Note] I am not re-uploading videos if they weren't originally uploaded to discord.

#### Update 2 - 10/17/2023
Since the original #90 listing was deleted from the discord, the server considered the next one #90 but I am keeping every single listing even if it was deleted so I will consider it listing #91.
[Note] Every listing on the Discord from #90 onwards is that listing number incremented by 1 here.
