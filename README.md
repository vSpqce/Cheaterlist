# Koro's CheaterList in a .txt file
## CheaterList
If you are here you should know what this is. If you don't, this is a list of cheaters (shocking) on Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Most if not all of these cheaters main The Hive.\
Why is this useful? No idea, just convenient for me so I decided to make it public to view lol.\
The program I created is a simple script that changes the date format from DD/MM/YY to MM/DD/YY since most of the dates in CheaterList were in the DMY format.


## Changes
I manually created this text file from the data in the [CheaterList](https://discord.gg/WNKQbacWU8) Discord server.\
I fixed some things and added one listing because koro didn't make an listing embed of it.\
I will probably update this as most listings are added. That's it, have a nice day.
